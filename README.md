# Hourvest

**See the real cost of your purchases in hours of your life.**

Hourvest is a lightweight Chrome extension that reframes every price you see online. Instead of just showing you dollars, it overlays the equivalent in **hours and minutes of your time** — based on your own hourly wage.

It runs quietly in the background, works across websites, and only appears when you hover over a price, so it’s there when you need perspective without getting in your way.

## Features

* **Time-based costs** → Instantly converts prices into “time worked.”

## Where It Shines

Hourvest is most useful in **shopping and spending contexts**, including:

* **E-commerce sites** → Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, etc.
* **Subscription services** → Streaming, SaaS products, app stores.
* **Travel & bookings** → Flights, hotels, car rentals.
* **Everyday browsing** → Anytime you come across a price tag online.

It’s designed to **work on most websites with price-like values** (numbers with `$`, `USD`, etc.), so you can bring awareness to spending decisions everywhere — not just one store.

## Why Hourvest?

Money is abstract. Time is personal. Hourvest helps you pause and ask:
**“Is this worth the hours of my life it will cost?”**
